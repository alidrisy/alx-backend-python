# Python Generators Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced use cases of **Python generators** to efficiently manage and process large datasets, stream database content, and simulate real-world data flows. The focus is on using the `yield` keyword to build memory-efficient pipelines and handle batch operations in real-time or near-real-time scenarios.


## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- ✅ Master Python generator functions and expressions
- ✅ Handle large datasets using **lazy evaluation** and **batch streaming**
- ✅ Simulate real-time data updates
- ✅ Optimize memory usage for aggregate operations
- ✅ Integrate Python with SQL databases like **MySQL** and **SQLite**

## Task 0: Getting Started with Python Generators

### Objective

Create a Python script (`seed.py`)
